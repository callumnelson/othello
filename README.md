# Shakespearean Othello 

![Game screenshot](https://github.com/callumnelson/othello/blob/main/assets/images/screenshot.png)

An Elizabethan era spin on the classic board game, Othello. Valid moves can be played anywhere that would create a "sandwich" by outflanking one or more of the opponent's pieces in one or more directions. Black always moves first. If a player cannot play, they must skip their turn. If a player can play, they must play. The game ends when one of the following conditions is met:
1. The board is full and there are no more available squares
2. Neither player has a valid move

The player with the most pieces of their color wins and ties are possible. The computer player utilizes a minimax algorithm with up to three levels of recursion to determine the best move available to it. Challenge her if you dare!
